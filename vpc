Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. 
This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, 
 with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

VPCs and Subnets
  * A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 
  * It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS
  
  * A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. 
  * You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. 
  * Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet,
    and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet.
    
  * To protect the AWS resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security,
     including security groups and network access control lists (ACL)    
    
By launching your instances into a VPC instead of EC2-Classic, you gain the ability to:

  *  Assign static private IPv4 addresses to your instances that persist across starts and stops
  *  Optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block to your VPC and assign IPv6 addresses to your instances
  *  Assign multiple IP addresses to your instances
  *  Define network interfaces, and attach one or more network interfaces to your instances
  *  Change security group membership for your instances while they're running
  *  Control the outbound traffic from your instances (egress filtering) in addition to controlling the inbound traffic to them (ingress filtering)
  *  Add an additional layer of access control to your instances in the form of network access control lists (ACL)
  *  Run your instances on single-tenant hardware
